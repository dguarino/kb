<p>This tool has been developed having in mind a fruitful interaction between modelers and experimenters.<br/>To improve your chances to get an answer and contribute to the Knowledge-Base, here are some tips:</p>

<h2>Do your homework</h2>
<p>Have you <b><a href="/knowledgebase/map">thoroughly searched for a statement</a></b> <i>before</i> asking your question?</p>

<h2>Be specific</h2>

<h2>Make it relevant to the Knowledge-Base</h2>
<p>Make it clear how your question is relevant to more people than just you, and more of experts will be interested in your question and willing to look into it.</p>

<h2>Be on-topic</h2>
<p>Statements are defined by a specific set of topics. Please try to stick to those topics.</p>

<h2>Keep an open mind</h2>
<p>A conclusive statement isn&rsquo;t always possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources of evidence and use comments to discuss...</p>
